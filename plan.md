# Plan of Action

remember this project is meant to explore triplet loss function and training image transformers

## things to implement 

- triplet data generator

- inception like cnn using keras

- triplet loss function 

- embedding similarity comparison function (just distance function for testing)

## style and other things?

- _no inheritance allowed!_ <= lets not be silly here, oo has its place just like functional

- keep in functional for the confusing bits (not strict)
